NTU IEM Year 1 _ IM1003 Final Project (Sudoku Warriors)

Project Description:
Sudoku Warriors is a Java-based game that allows players to play Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. My teammate and I have been developing and refining the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure a seamless and enjoyable gameplay experience for users. 

The game features a welcome screen with background music and three difficulty levels to choose from - Easy, Medium, and Hard. The game's graphical user interface is built using Java's Swing library, and the puzzles are randomly generated using backtracking algorithms. The game also has a timer that tracks the player's progress and a feature to check for errors. 

Technologies Used:
Java, Eclipse IDE, Swing library

Skills Demonstrated:
Object-oriented programming, Graphical user interface design, Algorithm development, Problem-solving and critical thinking, Teamwork
